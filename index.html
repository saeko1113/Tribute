        <h2>Casting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gon was first voiced by Rica Matsumoto in the 1998 Japanese film, and Junko Takeuchi in the 1999 series.[3] Elinor Holt voices him in the 1999 series in English.</li>
            <li>In Madhouse adaptation of the series, Gon is voiced by Megumi Han who found it as a unique experience when compared with other works most notably Sumire from Chihayafuru.[5] Voice actress Erica Mendez originally read for Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Menchi during casting of the series by Madhouse. The actress enjoyed Gon's personality and how well he judges others. However, she still did not like how Gon often put himself in dangerous situations like a common hero and does not care for his own well-being. In voicing the character, Mendez adds adds a rasp to a voice tends to make boy voices sound more believable to the audience, but because of the way they set him, he does not have a lot of rasp unless he is in a tense situation so sometimes he comeas across as feminine, haive and happy.[6]</li>
